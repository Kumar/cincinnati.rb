We held our 2nd Cincinnati.rb meeting last night, next meeting is December
9th.

Our first goal:
----------------

* Improve our testing skills.

First project:
----------------

We considered various projects, considered dipping toe in MERB, but in the
end decided to:

* Use git & github for source control
* Use Rails 2.1
* Use vanilla test/unit for testing
* No generators for anything other than migrations

We decided that speed isn't the goal on the project, it's for us all to
learn to practice true TFD as a group, maintaining 100% code coverage along
the way.

We'll build a site for Cincinnati.rb with the following stories:

http://github.com/cincinnatirb/cincinnati.rb/tree/master/doc%2Fstorie...
(ask me for github committer access if you want to add stories to the list)

All members present were added as committers on the project, but we decided
not to do any work on the project outside of the meeting, so everyone can
see the full process of developing the app.

TDD Hack Night meeting format (for next meeting):
----------------

PREP: Get your computer setup with git, connecting to the github repo, etc.
If your computer isn't setup, you can get it ready with a member offline, or
maybe a friendly member will sit out part of the meeting to help you get
setup.

MEETING: Everyone who has computer setup gets a turn as typist, pairing with
the group to implement the failing test (then commit/push), and then to
write a new failing test (then commit/push). Repeat around the table as we
work through user stories.

Ideas for other future meetings:
----------------

* Kids night
* Newbie night
* Q&A night -- bring your toughest ruby problems, we'll try to help you out
(30-min limit per member) 
* Code review night - bring your code, we'll do our best to help you improve it
* User testing night - bring your app, we'll give you group user feedback
